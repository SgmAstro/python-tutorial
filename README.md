# python-tutorial

The following Jupyter notebook files are used to introduce and teach Python to beginners. 
I use these files as a reference point when tutoring Python.

There are seven main tutorials at present:

1. A basic tutorial as an introduction to Python and programming as a whole.
2. An introduction to numpy
3. A guide to matplotlib
4. A guide to scipy
5. A guide to pandas (still work in progress)
6. A guide to astropy (still work in progress)
7. A guide to Cython (intro, work in progress)

I am continuing to build upon the guide to astropy given that it is highly useful to my work
in astrophysics, and I have in the past struggled to find good tutorials for this. I am also
building smaller guides to faciliate the understanding of ideas in computer science, such as
lambda calculus.
